                    <br>Through the integration of political messaging into trends and hashtags, campaigns can subtly guide public opinion without presenting themselves as explicitly political.

                There is a blurred line between conventional political advertising and the use of social media algorithms to manipulate public opinion.
            <br><br>
                While traditional campaigning relies on visible methods such as ads, posters, and flyers, algorithm-driven platforms operate in far less transparent ways. This is evident in Georgescu’s campaign, where he claimed to have spent <span class="redacted"> no money</span> on advertising and had <span class="redacted"> no campaign office</span>, yet still achieved significant online reach.
            <br><br>
                TikTok’s viralisation algorithm, which is based on <span class="redacted">undisclosed criteria</span>, has been shown to amplify political content, including <span class="redacted">hard-right material</span> during the Polish election, raising concerns about how these systems can influence democratic processes.
